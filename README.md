# MTH
Project created from scratch with [Pedro Tas Schindler]( https://github.com/ps3611) and [Steven van Asbeck]( https://github.com/stevenspyramid).
You will need to run the [MTH Client]( https://github.com/alvaroha1/mth-client))[MTH API]( https://github.com/alvaroha1/mth-api)) and [MTH Server]( https://github.com/alvaroha1/mth-server)).

## Motivation,
We realized there are multiple entry barriers to operate in the real-estate market. One of them is the existence of several data sources.
With MTH we wanted to create a platform to aggregate all the data and provide a layer of data analysis over the different opportunities.
Our client features a filter, a map and different metrics to help the user in their purchase decision.
